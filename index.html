    <p>Hi, I just wanted to say thank you for everything you’ve done for me—not just for the things you’ve done, but for the way you make me feel so, so special and loved every single day.</p>

    <p>We’ve faced a lot of challenges together, and through it all, you were always my strength and my comfort. Even on the hardest days, knowing that you were there for me made everything feel lighter. You’re the kindest, most amazing person I know, and I feel so lucky to have you in my life.</p>

    <p>Even though we’re not together anymore, I promised to always be by your side in spirit. Today would have been our anniversary if things had gone differently, but here I am, still writing this to you—because my heart wants you to know how much you mean to me.</p>

    <p>I miss the way we used to laugh together, the quiet moments when we didn’t need words, and the little things that made our love feel so real. Sometimes I wish I could go back and hold your hand just one more time, smile with you one more time, and tell you how deeply I care.</p>

    <p>Even in the sadness of being apart, a part of my heart will always belong to you. I will always wish the best for you, always cheer for you, and always hope you are happy. Thank you for the love we shared, for the memories we created, and for being the amazing person you are. 💖</p>
